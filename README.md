# python-api-challenge
The files for weatherpy.ipynb, vactionpy.ipynb, and output_data file are in the WeatherPY folder. In this challenged I had to use Geoapify API and Openweathermap API to search for hotels near cities with ideal weather conditions, filtering by temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness. Interactive maps were created (these are folder output_data) to visualize these cities and their nearest hotels, using hvplot to display key information such as hotel names and country. Throughout the assignment, I encountered difficulties with correctly configuring API requests and structuring the code to filter and display the hotel data. With the help of ChatGPT, I was able to troubleshoot issues, refine my code, and learn how to effectively implement the API and map visualizations.
